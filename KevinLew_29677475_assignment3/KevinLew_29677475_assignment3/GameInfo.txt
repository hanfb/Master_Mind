Losing hope of your future as countless employment applications are turned 
down one after another, one agency saw talent in you, and you are recruited 
by the Moldovan cipher bureau. You are to help crack a newly emerged encryption 
software “Master Mind”, in the hopes of a stable job and future promotions, 
you must defeat master mind.

As you stare at the screen knowing nothing of cryptography, lines of rules appear on your screen:
	1.	I (Master Mind) will decide a select any 4 numbers (from numbers 1-8) 
		in any combination to create the hidden code.
	2.	You will attempt to determine the hidden code by selecting 4 numbers at a time 
		by placing them in the order you think matches the hidden code. (easy right?)
	3.	Depending on the quality of your selection (not expecting much):
		-	If a number you selected is in my code, but in the wrong position, 
			(?) symbol will be displayed to taunt you and goad you into a false sense of security.
		-	If a number you selected is in my code and in the correct position, 
			(o) symbol will be displayed.
	4.	You will have 10 attempts, and if you STILL cannot correctly guess my code then you lose, 
		and you will lose your job. If you win then you get a cookie.

You may choose from the difficulty options:
	-	EASY (note: no future promotion) - 4 numbers (from numbers 0-5), 10 attempts
	-	NORMAL - 5 numbers (from numbers 0-7), 12 attempts
	-	ALCOHOLISM (when you lose your job) - 6 numbers (from numbers 0-9), 14 attempts

If you win 5 games in a row, you may choose to promote to a harder difficulty.
if you lose 5 games in a row you will be automatically DEMOTED (be thankful you still have the job).

YOU MAY ENTER 'quit' AT ANYTIME TO EXIT THE GAME.
